# Movie Ticket Booking System

## Project Description

This is a Java-based Movie Ticket Booking System,designed using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern.The application allows users to book movie tickets, view available movies,and manage bookings.It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) built with **JavaFX** and interacts with a **PostgreSQL** database to store movie and booking information.

The system includes the following features:
- Adding,updating,and deleting movies.
- Viewing all movies in the database.
- Booking tickets for selected movies with date and seat information.
- Managing bookings: adding,updating,and deleting bookings.
- User-friendly interface with message notifications for incorrect inputs.

## Project Requirements List

- **Movie Management**:
  1. Add a new movie with details such as title,genre,duration,release date,and rating.
  2. View a list of all available movies.
  3. Update movie details.
  4. Delete a movie from the database.

- **Booking Management**:
  5. Add a new booking (user name,movie title,seat count,showtime,booking date).
  6. View all bookings.
  7. Update booking details (user name,movie title,seat count,etc.).
  8. Delete a booking.

- **Database Interaction**:
  9. Database connection using **JDBC** to interact with a PostgreSQL database.
  10. Store and retrieve movie and booking data through SQL queries.

- **User Interface**:
  11. Graphical user interface (GUI) built with **JavaFX**.
  12. Input validation and user notifications for incorrect data or missing information.
  13. Responsive design for different screen sizes.
  
- **Testing**:
  14. Unit tests for the business logic of the Movie and Booking models.
  15. Ensuring the system functions correctly through integration tests.

## Code Structure

### Model:
- **Movie.java**: Represents the Movie entity,with attributes like title,genre,duration,release date,and rating.
- **Booking.java**: Represents a Booking entity,containing information like user name,movie title,seat count,showtime,and booking date.

### View:
- **HelloApplication.java**: The main entry point for the JavaFX application that initializes the GUI and launches the main stage.
- **HelloController.java**: Handles user input,including booking tickets,validating user data,and updating the GUI with notifications.

### Controller:
- **MovieDAO.java**: Provides data access methods for movie-related operations (CRUD-Create,Read,Update,Delete).
- **BookingDAO.java**: Handles database operations related to bookings.
- **DAOInterface.java**: A generic interface that both `MovieDAO` and `BookingDAO` implement to handle CRUD operations.

### Database:
- PostgreSQL is used as the database for storing movies and bookings.The system connects to the database through JDBC.

## Unit Testing

Unit tests for model methods are provided in the `test` directory.Tests ensure that the business logic for movies and bookings are functioning correctly, especially for CRUD operations.For testing,we used **JUnit**.
